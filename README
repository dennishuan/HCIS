Abstract:
Emergency departments (ED) and medical clinics in Metro Vancouver experience increasing number of visits and ED admissions. Integrating a web-based information system to unify patients' data from their general practitioners (GP), and their medical doctors (MD) is vital to maximize health care resources and services. Our project focuses on patients' data and their medical records in MySQL database management system (DBMS) to help with diagnosing, and efficiently performing treatments. Furthermore, our information system can provide data to health authorities to help better understand the growth in visits based on demographics, and provide better health services conducted from their statistical and decision analyses. Some analyses include: lower queue time in ED (which is known to be over two hours from Fraser Health hospitals).

Health authorities can export data to be used for decisiona and                       statistical analyses to provide better health care services (e.g. reduce queue time in ED, and to understand what               are the causes of growth in visits based on demographics). CSV file was chosen because it can be easily imported               to Excel, SAS, and R statistical analysis software.
